1) Explain about Mounting in life cycle component of react js?
  

     => Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

     => React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

         1 => constructor()
         2 => getDerivedStateFromProps()
         3 => render()
         4 => componentDidMount()
     => The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you 
define them.
